## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Summary of Regression Output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82230495/135175150-1a89a52d-b798-4b95-869f-c08753f1daf4.png)

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  The variables that show a non-random amount of variance are Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance.
  
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  
  The p-value for this model is 4.541e-11 meaning that this model shows statistically significant results and that we can assume that the slope of the model is not zero.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 
  This linear model does not predict mpg effectively because the Adjusted R-squared value is below the .70 line.

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

  The current manufacturing data meets this design specification for all lots overall but only for lots 1 and 2 individually.
