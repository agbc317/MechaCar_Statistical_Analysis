## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Summary of Regression Output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82230495/135175150-1a89a52d-b798-4b95-869f-c08753f1daf4.png)

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  The variables that show a non-random amount of variance are Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance.
  
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  
  The p-value for this model is 4.541e-11 meaning that this model shows statistically significant results and that we can assume that the slope of the model is not zero.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 
  This linear model does not predict mpg effectively because the Adjusted R-squared value is below the .70 line.
